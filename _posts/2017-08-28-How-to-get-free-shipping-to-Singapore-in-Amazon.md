Amazon has a free shipping program to Singapore if your orders are above 125 USD. Not sure how to take advantage of it? Let me show you how

# How to search for qualifying products?
From the amazon website it is stated as Items 20 lb. or more, certain oversize items, e-documents, software downloads, music downloads and gift cards don't qualify. So anything else does!!! Nah...there is a lot more catch to that. Let me tell u how you can find out.<br>
First up, search from [here](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=230659011). This is the amazon site which shows all product which are available for overseas shipping.

Mouse over to the top search bar and type in the thing you are searching for.<br>
Search results should show things relevant to what u type in the search box

Found something you want? Click on the item to go to the detailed descriptions.

In order for the product to qualify for free shipping,  ensure the product is shipped and sold by Amazon. Like the one below:

2nd will be if it is available for shipping to overseas. You can find that in the product details under the Shipping header. It should mention available for shipping to select countries outside the U.S. You might need to scroll down quite a bit to find it. If you do not want to strain your eyes to find it, do a search with your web browser for word "Product Details" to go to the location.

Once you selected your Singapore address and clicked continue.you should see the below.<br>

# I am not getting the free AmazonGlobal Saver!!!
The FREE AmazonGlobal Saver option did not appear for you? That means that something(s) in your cart is/are not eligible for the free shipping.<br>

Remember just one non-eligible item will void your free shipping.<br>

One way to check is to clear your cart leaving just a single product you wanted to buy. Set the quantity to such that the final value exceeds 125 USD. Check out the item to the point where you can select shipping option. If the free amazonglobal saver option is available, that means it is eligible for free shipping. If not, this is an item you need to remove in order to qualify for free shipping. Do the same for the rest of the products you wanted to purchase.<br>
