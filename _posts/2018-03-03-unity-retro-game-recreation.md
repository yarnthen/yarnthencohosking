I am trying to learn how to program using Unity 3D to fulfill a childhood desire to create games. After going through tutorials galore, I somehow did not feel I achieved much in learning other than basic stuff. As the saying goes,

So the best way to learn something is by actually doing it, so might as well roll up my sleeves and start on it! 

The ancient games like Pong, Space Invaders, and Arkanoid are relatively straightforward, to begin with, and there are already tons of tutorials online or in the Udemy courses which everyone can just follow the instructors to do it. 

Born in the 1980s meant I was part of the action for video games from Nintendo and Sega.  Recently I was browsing Youtube and noticed NES, SNES, Genesis video gameplay popping out, that brought out nostalgic feelings in me. So I decided to recreate games from that generation of video games which is NES games. 

NES games are 8 bit, and just a few buttons for control, recreating it in Unity should just be a piece of cake. Wrong! It is very challenging to create those nostalgic games using Unity. Because to efficiently use Unity, you would need to make good use of its physics engine which if you are from the NES playing era will know how different Physics work in the NES games. 

I have lots of hair pulling sessions trying to figure why things don't work out the same when creating those old games while it worked perfectly for more advanced/modern gameplay and that results in countless googling and StackOverflow/Unity Forum scouring. 

Ok, enough grumbling,  I have my mind set on the games I want to recreate. Below are the links to all the tutorials.
