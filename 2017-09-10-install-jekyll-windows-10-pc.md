Jekyll is one of the most popular Static Site generator which have been used around by a lot of people to create their blogs and website. Compared to sites/blogs created using Wordpress or Joomla, it has the advantage of speed(which means Search Engine likes it) because Jekyll do not need to call database for data loading and will simply need to serve static pages. In addition, it is more secured than Wordpress because there is no database to be hacked. The reason why it is not so popular compared to Wordpress is because:

1. The learning curve is much higher especially for people with minimal or no programming knowledge
2. To create a Jekyll website on the most popular OS (Windows) is difficult and more manual.

I am taking this opportunity to show in this post in step by step how you can install Jekyll on Windows 10 computer.
